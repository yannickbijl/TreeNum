# TreeNum

A small program in python to calculate the number of unrooted and rooted trees when one has a specific number of organisms.

The program uses the modules sys, math and the third-party module wx-python 4.0 (Phoenix) [WxPython](https://www.wxpython.org/ "WxPython")

The executable was made using pyinstaller on Windows 10 Home-edition 64-bit.

In the project folder open the cmd and use the command: **pyinstaller -F --icon=TreeNum.ico -w TreeNum.py**

The icon was made in Adobe Illustrator

TreeNum.py is the main file, GUI_TreeNumber.py is used to generate the user interface, and ESC_TreeNumber.py does the calculations needed.
